While I didn’t end up in the same group as them, I’m glad to have cleared the semester with a great team. I also wanted to do CS4236 Cryptography Theory and Practice this semester but I knew no one who wanted to do this in year 2 :(</p>\n<h2 id=\"modules-taken\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#modules-taken\" aria-label=\"modules taken permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Modules Taken</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CS2100 Computer Organisation</li>\n<li>CS2103 Software Engineering</li>\n<li>IS1103 IS Innovations in Organisations and Society</li>\n<li><a href=\"#MA2214\">MA2214 Combinatorics and Graphs I</a></li>\n<li>ULT2299C Topics in Literature 2: The Subject of Reading</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"a-idma2214a-ma2214-combinatorics-and-graphs-i\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idma2214a-ma2214-combinatorics-and-graphs-i\" aria-label=\"a idma2214a ma2214 combinatorics and graphs i permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"MA2214\"></a> MA2214 Combinatorics and Graphs I</h3>\n<p>I expected more from the module in terms of content, as H3 Mathematics already covered a good portion of the content. Nevertheless, I enjoyed learning about Generating Functions. I was actually looking forward to the graph portion but turns out it’s mostly covered in part two of the module.</p>\n<p>I bought the book because I love this topic so much, even though I already had an online copy of it. Absolutely not necessary to buy, but there are exercises inside that would help if you do get it. No answers provided, so find some friends to work on the problems together.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/review-s3","tagSlugs":["/tag/module-reviews/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-31","description":"Reviews for modules taken in my third semester in NUS","tags":["module reviews"],"title":"Module Reviews and Study Tips - S3"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/review-s3"}}}
