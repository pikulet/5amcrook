By now, I was fairly confident of my intuition of basic programming concepts.</p>\n<p>I decided to join my friends in the 2017 Advent of Code. Advent of Code release 25 puzzles over the 25 days leading to Christmas, functioning very much like an Advent calender. Every day, a new challenge is released. Depending on how fast you solve these puzzles, you get stars in a leaderboard.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you play with 3 friends, then on your private leaderboard the first person to complete each puzzle gets 3 stars. It’s a simple scoring system that really brings out the competitive spirit in fellow programmers. More than that, it keeps us active during a lull period where there would be no lessons (and hence no compulsory programming).</p>\n<p>The puzzles started out simple, where I got used to opening and reading files in python.</p>\n<p>However, having a lack of advanced data structures and algorithms knowledge, I got stuck at a third of the way. For the next 2 to 3 days, I ended up looking at how my friends had solved them. Eventually, my friends got busy and no one actually persisted through 25 days. </p>\n<p>It is a pity, but we will be back next year!</p>\n<h4 id=\"remarks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#remarks\" aria-label=\"remarks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Remarks</h4>\n<p>Look out for the update every December at <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">adventofcode.com</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/aoc-17","tagSlugs":["/tag/advent-of-code/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-12-30","description":"Reflections on the Advent of Code 2017 season.","tags":["advent of code"],"title":"2017 Advent of Code"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/aoc-17"}}}
