I’ve thought about why they even have this module here, and it’s partly a quality check on the students that leave NUS. It’s not called statistics, it’s called quantitative <strong>reasoning</strong>. The module wants to ensure that NUS grads have the ability to make numerical and objective decisions, whenever the time for these choices comes.</p>\n<p>We had weekly online lectures for this. There were slides, and usually I will read the slides when they are out, then find some time on the weekend to speed through the video. The weekly quizzes were quite enjoyable to work through (simple, light problems for anyone with basic mathematical and statistical training) but I always made it a point to check my answers with some friends.</p>\n<p>The project was an unexpectedly good part of this module. The groups were pre-assigned for us but my group was just amazing! We didn’t spend too long on the project, I recall one late consultation with the professor (compulsory), where he gave feedback on our project. Most of our poster was done in one sitting, really fuss-free so that’s great. I’m proud of our final <a href=\"/ger-poster.pdf\">project poster</a>.</p>\n<p>As most of the students in this module intend to S/U the module, minimal effort can guarantee a good grade.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-idma1100a-ma1100-fundamental-concepts-of-mathematics\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idma1100a-ma1100-fundamental-concepts-of-mathematics\" aria-label=\"a idma1100a ma1100 fundamental concepts of mathematics permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"MA1100\"></a> MA1100 Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics</h3>\n<p>I was already looking forward to this module because it sounded so fundamental. It’s actually light in content but really got me thinking about mathematical constructs. We started off Mathematical Induction using the Peano axioms, then spent most of the semester working on Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory (ZFC). The content stopped at cardinality studies (countable and uncountable infinities) and the Well-Ordering Principle.</p>\n<p>The first half of the semester involved things most people with mathematics background would already know, albeit presenting them in a different light. I formally understood functions as relations, and we had rigorous questions on injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity proofs. The midterm was also really <strong>fun</strong> because it was 80 true/ false questions with negative marking. Negative marking was enforced because mathematics is about working on axioms, and making unbased claims is serious!</p>\n<p>The exams were made easy. The midterm was mostly repeated off a past paper, and the final repeated questions from the midterm. However, any small mistake could throw you off. It was imperative to be careful and rigorous.</p>\n<p>Additional Note: I bought the recommended book (Fundamentals of Mathematics by Bernd S.W. Schroder) and still keep it because it’s a great read.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-idcs1010sa-cs1010s-programming-methodology-i\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idcs1010sa-cs1010s-programming-methodology-i\" aria-label=\"a idcs1010sa cs1010s programming methodology i permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"CS1010S\"></a> CS1010S Programming Methodology I</h3>\n<p>I already wrote above how this module is so great that it solidified my decision to switch to CS. I loved it thoroughly. I didn’t actually go for lectures or watch the videos, I found my learning was maximised by reading the slides (to understand the syntax) and then working on missions.</p>\n<p>It’s so important to keep up with the module and do the work on your own. The content is presented in a very accessible manner. The finals were also decently challenging, testing concepts of functions as first-order objects in Python.</p>\n<p>There’s really no need to worry about having programming background or anything because the pace is prepared for absolute beginners. Having a strong grasp of logic would help debug your code in times of trouble. A great recommendation for anyone looking to explore what programming is.</p>\n<p>In fact, after having been a teaching assistant for CS1101S Programming Methodology I (the equivalent module for Computer Science students), I must say that CS1010S is better in many ways. The module is very well-organised and well-paced. Content-wise, a bit is left out (Lego Mindstorms EV3, meta-evaluators) but the learning is way more effective in CS1010S, especially for beginners.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/review-s1","tagSlugs":["/tag/module-reviews/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-12-31","description":"Reviews for modules taken in my first semester in NUS","tags":["module reviews"],"title":"Module Reviews and Study Tips - S1"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/review-s1"}}}
