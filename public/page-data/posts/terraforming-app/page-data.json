Apparently, by sitting in her desk for 24 hours a day, she is able to collect extensive feedback on your island. Yes, she can tell when you have more than 220 trees, or when there are overgrown weeds in <em>that</em> corner of your island.</p>\n<p>When players hit 3 stars (out of a maximum possible rating of 5 stars), Tom Crook will offer them permits to shape up the island. The ACNH community commonly refers to this as terraforming. New players visiting islands only have one thing on their minds - to unlock terraforming and decorating their islands to their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>New players often visit 5-star islands and are so amazed at the quality of the decoration and terraforming. “I can’t wait for terraforming”, they say. But when they find out you have to work on everything on tile at a time, we all hear their hearts drop.</p>\n<p>smolcano shared: “Yes, it took me 10 days to fully terraform my island. I’ve had bridges destroyed, cliffs built and waterfalls scaped.” smolcano expressed intense disappointment at how long the terraforming process took. I casually let her know that constructions workers spend months and years on a project, and they often work under scorching suns. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, <a href=\"https://bobacupcake.itch.io/island-planner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">island planners</a> have now been developed by the lovely community. This has been shared multiple times and deserves more sharing.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/terraforming-app","tagSlugs":["/tag/terraform/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-29","description":"I'm going to spend the next ten days moving my villagers' houses to the beach so I can properly terraform this area.","tags":["terraform"],"title":"Tireless Terraforming - Destroy, Build, Round the Corner"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/terraforming-app"}}}
