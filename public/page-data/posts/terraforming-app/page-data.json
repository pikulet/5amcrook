Apparently, by sitting in her desk for 24 hours a day, she is able to collect extensive feedback on your island. Yes, she can tell when you have more than 220 trees, or when there are overgrown weeds in <em>that</em> corner of your island.</p>\n<p>When players hit 3 stars (out of a maximum possible rating of 5 stars), Tom Crook will offer them permits to shape up the island. The ACNH community commonly refers to this as terraforming. New players visiting islands only have one thing on their minds - to unlock terraforming and decorating their islands to their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>“I can’t wait for terraforming”, they say. But when they find out you have to work on everything on tile at a time, we all hear their hearts drop.</p>\n<p>smolcano shared: “Yes, it took me 10 days to fully terraform my island. I’ve had bridges destroyed, cliffs built and waterfalls scaped.”</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/0781d/terra-relac.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/8ac56/terra-relac.webp 240w,\n/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/d3be9/terra-relac.webp 480w,\n/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/e46b2/terra-relac.webp 960w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/5a194/terra-relac.jpg 240w,\n/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/8a430/terra-relac.jpg 480w,\n/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/0781d/terra-relac.jpg 960w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/fd26d960ee4f1b31dfe3179c245b5b2c/0781d/terra-relac.jpg\"\n          alt=\"smolcano takes a break\"\n          title=\"smolcano takes a break\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>smolcano expressed intense disappointment at how long the terraforming process took.
