No regrets, since it didn’t actually affect my overall schedule.</p>\n<p>This module was enjoyable and light. Assignments were of manageable difficulty. I found the content being all over the place but I did read through the entire textbook (relevant chapters) before the final exam. I skipped the details I already knew, but the textbook did give me a good overview of the internet architecture and helped me mentally organise the concepts in my mind.</p>\n<p>This is a good class to take with friends because you’ll find yourself suddenly wanting to know details like “Is the MAC address replaced with R’s MAC?” at the most random moments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-idcs3243a-cs3243-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idcs3243a-cs3243-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence\" aria-label=\"a idcs3243a cs3243 introduction to artificial intelligence permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"CS3243\"></a> CS3243 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>I took this module knowing it will very likely be the last AI-related module I will take. I thought it would be a lot on statistical methods and regression techniques but turns out, it’s so different. This class focusses on AI concepts and formalising problems for computers. The first half was on search problems, then came a portion on logic programming and finally bayesian networks.</p>\n<p>I found the content very intuitive and logical in nature, especially with alpha-beta pruning, CNF formulas and bayesian networks. The professor’s lecture style was also fun.</p>\n<p>However, the project (poker) was pretty unguided and unorganised. It’s the first iteration of this project, so there are bound to be problems. It’s probably the first time most students have trained some kind of agent, and the project is really unaccessible and feels more like a machine learning project. Some suggestions I had: give some sample papers on training a linear agent, CFR and DQN (these are algorithms used by researchers in competitive poker AI). </p>\n<p>My team went for experimentation and ideas over performance as the professor wanted more originality in the projects. We did well overall despite losing the tournaments pretty badly. Our paper covered a lot on analysing existing techniques and uncovering what it means for a program to be recognised as an intelligent poker player. We were also the only team to put together the CFR and DQN methods (they are pretty unrelated).</p>\n<p>A good introduction to the field of AI, but not as practical as I expect CS3244 Machine Learning to be. I believe the ML module covers perceptron algorithms and different types of neural networks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-idcs3245a-cs3245-information-retrieval\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idcs3245a-cs3245-information-retrieval\" aria-label=\"a idcs3245a cs3245 information retrieval permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"CS3245\"></a> CS3245 Information Retrieval</h3>\n<p>Before taking this class, I was clueless on what information retrieval meant. I didn’t even know the class was on search engines.</p>\n<p>The class started off on a good note as the professor created a friendly learning environment for everyone. The assignments are paced over the semester, and mostly involve implementing known algorithms (these are pretty large and complex algorithms).</p>\n<p>The modules covers basic indexing and searching algorithms in search engines, how the performance of search engines can be evaluated, and extensions used to improve search results (such as PageRank). In learning about indexing, problems on processing text and the nature of different languages were also covered. I enjoyed the mathematical aspects like Kappa values to determine agreement - how do you determine if a document is indeed “relevant”?</p>\n<p>It’s a very practical module as I walked away feeling more confident in writing medium-size programs (~500 LoC). Many practical algorithms are also covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-idst2334a-st2334-probability-and-statistics\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idst2334a-st2334-probability-and-statistics\" aria-label=\"a idst2334a st2334 probability and statistics permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"ST2334\"></a> ST2334 Probability and Statistics</h3>\n<p>This module is predominantly A-level Statistics content. If you already have a good grasp of hypothesis testing, then the only new thing is the F distribution.</p>\n<p>Do not get too lost in the many distributions that exist. It’s most important to understand fundamental definitions like expectation and variance, and the basic techniques in hypothesis testing. Regardless of whatever distribution you’re testing against, the steps are the same.</p>\n<p>This was another module I dreaded. The probability parts were unfortunately small :( I also didn’t learn many new things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-idma3233a-ma3233-combinatorics-and-graphs-ii\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-idma3233a-ma3233-combinatorics-and-graphs-ii\" aria-label=\"a idma3233a ma3233 combinatorics and graphs ii permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a id=\"MA3233\"></a> MA3233 Combinatorics and Graphs II</h3>\n<p>This module only had 19 students when I took it. While I didn’t actually talk to most of my classmates, I did make a few friends here.</p>\n<p>The class is of suitable difficulty. There are 7 topics - eulerian graphs, hamiltonian graphs, connectivity, matching/ cover/ independence, planar graphs, colouring, tournaments and digraphs.</p>\n<p>A lot of theorems are taught, and the professor goes through their proof in class. The assignments require application of these theorems to derive properties of given graphs. It’s good to get to know some people in this class so you can discuss questions and learn about different ways to interpret the graphs.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/review-s4","tagSlugs":["/tag/module-reviews/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-05-31","description":"Reviews for modules taken in my fourth semester in NUS","tags":["module reviews"],"title":"Module Reviews and Study Tips - S4"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/review-s4"}}}
