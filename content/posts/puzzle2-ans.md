Explanation:
- 1: The blue one when you eat Singapore's forbidden candy. **Francine** is the blue rabbit on the cover of K.K. Bubblegum. Chewing gum is banned in Singapore.
- 2: A colour you can dig from the ground. **Amber** is a orange-ish colour, and also the name of a fossil.
- 3: Lurking outside our doors at night. **Moth** is the bug that flies outside our doors (due to the light).
- 4: The variant of the bow, where we hang our blue and yellow necklaces. You have to look at the accessory stand. There will be only variant with a blue and yellow necklace. The colour of the bow there is **pink**.
- 5: The prettiest fungus. **Elegant**. There are 5 types of mushrooms in the game. Southerners would know best as they are currently in season!
- 6: A villager on a tree. **Apple** is the one of the villagers in the game, and also a fruit that grows on trees.
- 7: A dress to play poker with. The **adventure** dress has the poker suits lining the bottom of it.
- 8: Who you look for to be saved from tough spots. **Resetti**. That's just a factoid, the name of the person who does rescue service for you ðŸ™‚
