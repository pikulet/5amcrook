Recently, the Katana glitch has been making rounds among the ACNH community. tldr; these asexual swords have the ability to propagate themselves using the help of table rotations. This means that katanas are only worth as much as the time it takes to make table rotations. The hitherto rare item is now ubiquitous.

While most players have been spending their hours making copies of the katana, smolcano shared about her money duplication trick. She is able to directly duplicate bells by visiting a friends' island and making bets on their colourful wheel.

In the meantime, we can anticipate the Indonesian silat industry to be blooming as Animal Crossing players hone their katana kraft.
