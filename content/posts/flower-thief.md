A flower thief was caught on CCTV stealing smolcano's flowers. This behaviour is frowned upon by most people.

A very apt Chinese term can be used to describe this group of people:

> 采花贼

According to new laws, the thief will be fined \$300 for not wearing a mask. A doctor's mask only costs \$160 ingame, but limited supplies have meant that each user can only buy 5 a day.

*( trigger warning for 采花贼: While the literally meaning is a flower thief, it's usually used to refer to bastardous criminals )*
